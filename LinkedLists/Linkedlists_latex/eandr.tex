\section{Description of output}
\State {\hspace*{1cm}The method used for testing the aplication follow these steps :}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item create two linked lists, one by pushing first and another by pushing last (push first and push last functions)
    \item print the initial state of a list (print list function)
    \item delete an element and print the new element from that position (delete pos and pop pos functions)
    \item insert an element then print the element from that position (push pos and pop pos functions)
    \item print the length of list (length list function)
    \item append the two lists (append lists functions)
    \item print the appended lists and their length (print list and length list functions)
\end{enumerate}
\State{\hspace*{1cm}In order to test that the output is correct, i used two more functions : print a list and print an element from a given position.}
\State{\hspace*{1cm}Once the program used a function we verify the result :}
\begin{itemize}
    \item create lists -> print lists and the length of lists
    \item delete an element from a position -> print the new element from the deleted element position
    \item insert an element on a position -> print the element from that position
    \item append the two lists -> print the appended lists and their length
\end{itemize}
\State{\hspace*{1cm}The output data represent the verififcation of linked lists functions. The output file follow these steps :}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item initial state of a list
    \item the element from a position in list, before and after we delete him
    \item list resulted
    \item an element, and a position, which will be inserted in list
    \item the element from that position in list
    \item length of list
    \item list resulted
    \item length of appended lists
    \item appended lists
\end{enumerate}
